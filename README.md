This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

The deployed application can be found here: https://grim-crypt-37893.herokuapp.com/ 

1. The survey has 10 questions, and each answer are on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. Once the user finished the survey, the name and picture of the best match for the user is displayed.
